Description of Project: 
The Mechanical Tree, otherwise known as the Radiative Cooling Shade Structure, is a design intended to provide shade to students at ASU 
and ultize underground plumbing to cool the ground to cool the cemented floor and reverese the effect of urban sprawl and it's heat island effect. The "leaves" would be solar panels designed to power the 
Tree, and provide light in the nightime. This prototype was designed and created through the Grand Challeneges Scholar Program and was 
presented at an end-of-the-semester panel, and won 1st place. 


Design Process: 
First, a sketch was made to visualize the Tree, along with its inner components. Next, research was done to figure out how hydraulic power and solar power can work together 
to provide power to the tree, as well as cooling to the students walking by.
